# Jaccard Similarity
Jaccard Similarity is highly useful in Natural Language Processing, as they can give a similarity measure between two words or sentences to a certain level. Jaccard Similarity is a measure of similarity between two sets, which means higher the value of Jaccard Similarity, the more similar the two sets are. 

In this example, I am comparing the similarity between two text passages using the Jaccard index.
